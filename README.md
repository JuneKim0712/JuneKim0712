# Intro

Hello! My name is Junwoo (June) Kim.

I'm a rising junior at Redwood High School, and I am interested in using machine learning to improve teaching and accessibility. 
I took an interest in this due to people I met new people in the field of AI, who were passionate people interested in how AI is going change the world
and how to apply them properly and promote diversity.

Although there isn't much project that I could show public on GitHub, I am currently working on a project with @FNLHub and @cosgiant on Machine learning on ASL.

If you have any questions, contact me on LinkedIn or at junwoo.kim071212@gmail.com!
